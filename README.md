# minesweeper

<p>Base is from [bharatr](https://github.com/bharatr1993/WxWidgets-Minesweeper), who copied from [javid9](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9) (but did implement useful, yet buggy, aspects)</p>

### TODO:
<p>-Working buttons:<br>
	-Reset<br>
	-Highscores<br>
--Timer<br>
---Input (for board) (console temporary or permanent?)<br>
Bot (decide which variant)<br>
Bugfixxing<br>
!Devide to multiple files<br><br>
?Click to reveal on number<br>
?Reveal surrounding 0's (no manual clicks)<br>
?Endgame screen</p>

### Extra details
<p>b.sh for easier compilation<br>
highscores is just a demo for future (unimportant)<br>
seems to maybe leak HEAVY memory (or maybe Im dreaming?)</p>

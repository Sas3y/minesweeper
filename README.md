# minesweeper

<p>Base is from [bharatr](https://github.com/bharatr1993/WxWidgets-Minesweeper), who copied from [javid9](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9) (but did implement useful, yet buggy, aspects)</p>

### TODO:
<p>--Timer<br>
-Reset<br>
-Bot<br>
--Input (for board)<br>
And much more :)</p>

### Extra details
<p>b.sh for easier compilation<br>
highscores is just a demo for future (unimportant)<br>
seems to maybe leak HEAVY memory (or maybe Im dreaming?)</p>
